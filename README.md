## HuBMAP

- To segment instances of micro-vascular structures from healthy human kidney tissue slides.
- Utilized semi-supervised learning (SSL) for training a YOLOv8x model in instance segmentation with only 20% labeled data. Implemented self-training to harness the combined power of labelled and unlabelled data, effectively optimizing model performance.
- Achieved substantial enhancement in instance segmentation, raising overall mAP50-95 score from 0.47 to a remarkableÂ 0.591
